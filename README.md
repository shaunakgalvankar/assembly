# assembly
#these codes are written keeping in mind instructions of intels 8086 microprocessor.
#they can be run on assemblers like TASM NASM MASM etc though i have personally tested all of them on TASM using MSDOS box for runnning it on OSx.


To convert the .asm files into an object code we use the tasm command followed by the file name,to further convert it into a 
windows executable (.exe) we then tlink the file which does the linking process.You may wonder that i mentioned i was using osx then why am i creating .exe's
weel all the code that i tested was in dosbox which makes a virtual machine and executes everything onto it.
